## Introduction

PDFly is a powerful tool that allows you to interact with your PDF documents through a chat interface. You can ask questions, get summaries, and more, all through a simple and intuitive interface.

## Features

- Chat with your PDFs
- Upload and manage PDF documents
- Get summaries and insights from your PDFs

P.S.: Oh, and about that API endpoint for uploading PDFsâ€”yeah, itâ€™s not going to work. Why? Because the embedding model needs infrastructure fancier than what free hosting services offer, and guess what? They all said nope. I could have hosted it on my Azure VM, but letâ€™s be honest, Iâ€™m not about to burn my precious credits on a pre-interview assignment.

But hey, if youâ€™re feeling adventurous (or just really determined), you can run it locally. Everything you need to get started is written in this README. Knock yourself out!

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (v3.8 or higher)
- [Supabase Account](https://www.supabase.com/) (for database)
- [Pinecone Account](https://pinecone.io) (for vector db)
- [Langsmith Account](smith.langchain.com) (for LLM monitoring)
- [Firestore Account](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) (No longer needed)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pdfly.git
    cd pdfly
    ```

2. Install dependencies for both backend and frontend:

    ```sh
    cd backend
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    cd ../frontend
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Development Server

#### Backend

1. Set up environment variables:

    Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with the discussed in section [Environment Variables](#environment-variables-1)

2. Run the backend server:

    ```sh
    cd backend
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    python main.py
    ```

#### Frontend

1. Set up environment variables:

    Create a `.env.local` file in the frontend directory with the content discussed in section [Environment Variables](#environment-variables-1)


2. Run the frontend server:

    ```sh
    cd frontend
    npm run dev
    ```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
